        <p>
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It forms the foundation of web pages and is understood by web browsers to display text, images, links, multimedia, and other elements in a structured manner. </p>



        <article>
            <h3>Markup Structure:</h3>
            <p> HTML uses a set of tags to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs: opening tags and closing tags. The content to be affected by a tag is placed between these tags.
</p>
            <h3>Elements</h3>
            <p> HTML elements consist of a tag name and may include attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as its styling or behavior.</p>
            <h3>Document Structure</h3>
            <p> An HTML document generally begins with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration to indicate the version of HTML being used. This is followed by the <html> element, which contains two main sections: the <head> section (metadata like title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets or scripts) and the <body> section (visible content of the web page).</p>

            <p>So in Javascript, one can declare a variable using let/const/var.
                Basically, we can divide those into two.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>let/const - block level scoped</li>
                <li>Var - function level scoped</li>
            </ul>
